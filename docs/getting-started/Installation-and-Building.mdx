## Overview

This guide explains how to build the StableNet node client (`gstable`) from source.  
It covers local builds for development, CI-style builds, cross-compilation, and Docker-based builds.

If you are looking to **run an already built node**, see:
- Node configuration
- Genesis setup and network types

## Prerequisites

### Go

StableNet requires **Go 1.22 or later**.

The production build uses Go **1.22.x**.  
If your local Go version differs, the build system can automatically download the correct version.

```bash
go version
