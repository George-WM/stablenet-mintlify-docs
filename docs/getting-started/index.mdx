This guide provides an introduction to installing, building, and running your first StableNet node. It covers the essential prerequisites, build process, and initial node setup to get you operational quickly.

For detailed build instructions and CI/CD pipeline information, see **Installation and Building**.  
For comprehensive configuration options, see **Node Configuration**.  
For genesis block creation and customization, see **Genesis Setup and Network Types**.

## Overview

StableNet is a stablecoin-focused blockchain that uses the WBFT (WEMIX Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus engine, referred to as **Anzeon** in this implementation.

The primary executable is `gstable`, which functions as both a full node and a validator. Unlike standard Ethereum, StableNet requires a custom genesis configuration to deploy governance contracts at block 0 and initialize the validator set.

The build system is managed via `Makefile` and `build/ci.go`.

Build the main executable:

```bash
make gstable
