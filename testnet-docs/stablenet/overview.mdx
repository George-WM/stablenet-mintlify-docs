description: "High-level overview of the StableNet blockchain architecture, economics, and governance model."

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level introduction to the StableNet blockchain, its stablecoin-focused architecture, key differences from standard Ethereum, and the role of the Anzeon WBFT consensus and governance system.

## Scope

This overview covers the fundamental design principles and architecture of StableNet. For detailed guides, refer to:

- Node setup and configuration: Getting Started
- Consensus internals: WBFT Consensus Protocol
- Governance contracts: System Contracts Overview
- Gas fee mechanics: Gas Fee Policy

## What is StableNet?

StableNet is a blockchain protocol designed specifically for stablecoin operations, forked from the WBFT (WEMIX Byzantine Fault Tolerance) implementation. It maintains full EVM compatibility while introducing fundamental changes to support a fiat-pegged stablecoin as the native base coin used for gas payments.

### Core Innovation

Unlike traditional blockchains where the base coin is pre-minted and subject to market volatility, StableNet implements a **1:1 fiat-pegged base coin** with dynamic minting and burning. Supply changes are controlled through a decentralized oracle-based minter system that verifies real-world fiat deposits and withdrawals.

### Key Characteristics

- Proof-of-Authority (PoA) validator architecture using Anzeon WBFT
- Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus
- Zero inflation (no block rewards)
- Governance-controlled priority fee (`gasTip`)
- Base fees paid to validators (not burned)
- ERC20-compatible native coin via `NativeCoinAdapter`

## Architectural Differences from Ethereum

| Aspect | Ethereum | StableNet |
|---|---|---|
| Consensus | PoS (Beacon Chain) | PoA with WBFT |
| Base Coin | ETH | Fiat-pegged stablecoin |
| Coin Supply | Fixed + rewards | Dynamic mint/burn |
| Block Rewards | Yes | No |
| Base Fee | Burned | Paid to validators |
| Priority Fee | User-defined | Governance-defined |
| Block Time | ~12s | ~1s (configurable) |

## System Architecture Overview

StableNet follows the standard Ethereum client architecture with critical modifications in the consensus, genesis initialization, gas policy, and system contracts.

Key components include:

- Node initialization and lifecycle management
- WBFT consensus engine
- Modified miner/worker pipeline
- System contracts injected at genesis
- ERC20-compatible native coin adapter

---

## Stablecoin Economics Model

StableNet enforces **zero inflation** and a **strict 1:1 fiat peg**.

### Economic Principles

1. No speculative issuance or pre-mining
2. Supply changes only via mint/burn
3. Fiat-backed issuance verified off-chain
4. Validator revenue derived solely from transaction fees
5. Fully auditable on-chain supply changes

### Fee Distribution

All transaction fees are paid directly to the block validator:

- `baseFee`: protocol-controlled
- `gasTip`: governance-controlled
- No fee burning
- No block rewards

---

## Governance System

StableNet uses on-chain governance with five system contracts deployed at fixed addresses during genesis:

- **NativeCoinAdapter (0x1000)** – ERC20 interface for the native coin
- **GovValidator (0x1001)** – validator set and gas policy
- **GovMasterMinter (0x1002)** – minter registry
- **GovMinter (0x1003)** – mint/burn approval
- **GovCouncil (0x1004)** – future governance extensions
